Merry Christmas Simulation

This project is a visually stunning Python-based simulation to celebrate Christmas. It creates a beautiful animated Christmas tree with lights, stars, snowflakes, and a glowing tree-top star, all set against a peaceful night sky.

Features

1. Christmas Tree

A multi-layered green pine tree drawn using polygons.

A sturdy trunk at the base of the tree.

2. Tree Lights

Spiraling dynamic lights with colors ranging from red to purple.

Lights shimmer dynamically for a festive look.

3. Tree-Top Star

A glowing, animated star at the tree's apex, surrounded by a soft radiance.

4. Stars in the Sky

Animated, twinkling stars of varying sizes and brightnesses.

5. Falling Snowflakes

Realistic snowflakes with varying sizes and speeds that gently fall across the screen.

Technology Used

Programming Language: Python

Graphics Library: Pygame

How It Works

Main Components

Christmas Tree:

The tree's crown is made of three green triangular layers.

The trunk is a brown rectangle at the bottom.

Spiral Lights:

Lights are distributed along a spiral using trigonometric functions for precise placement.

Each light's color and brightness update dynamically.

Tree-Top Star:

The star is a circle surrounded by multiple glowing layers, creating a halo effect.

Twinkling Stars:

Each star is a small polygon that changes brightness in a pulsating manner.

Falling Snowflakes:

Snowflakes fall at random speeds and reset to the top once they reach the bottom of the screen.

Animation Loop

The program uses a main loop that:

Updates the positions and states of stars and snowflakes.

Redraws all elements on the screen in each frame.

Installation and Usage

Prerequisites

Install Python (version 3.8 or higher recommended).

Install the Pygame library:

pip install pygame

Running the Program

Save the script to a file, e.g., christmas_tree.py.

Run the script using Python:

python christmas_tree.py

Enjoy the Christmas-themed animation!

Customization

Colors: Modify the colors list to change the light colors.

Snowflake Density: Adjust the number of snowflakes by changing the snowflakes list size.

Star Count: Modify the stars list size to increase or decrease sky stars.

Frame Rate: Adjust clock.tick(144) for smoother or faster animations.

Project Structure

draw_tree_crown: Draws the treeâ€™s green layers.

draw_tree_trunk: Draws the tree trunk.

generate_spiral_lights: Generates coordinates for tree lights.
