Christmas Tree Animation with Pygame 🎄✨
This project creates a festive Christmas-themed animation using Pygame, featuring:

A decorated Christmas tree with spiral lights.
Realistic, dynamically twinkling stars.
Snowflakes that fall smoothly across the screen.
A glowing star at the top of the tree.
Features
🎄 Christmas Tree
Tree Crown: Designed with three layers of polygons to resemble a traditional Christmas tree.
Tree Trunk: A rectangular base to give the tree a complete structure.
💡 Spiral Lights
Spiral lights wrap around the tree in a 3D effect.
Each light dynamically changes its brightness for a realistic appearance.
❄️ Snowflakes
Snowflakes are realistic, featuring:
Six-sided geometry with added branching for realism.
Randomized sizes and speeds for variety.
🌟 Twinkling Stars
Stars appear in the upper part of the screen.
Each star dynamically twinkles by changing its brightness over time.
⭐ Tree Top Glow
The tree is crowned with a glowing star, surrounded by a pulsating aura for added magic.
How It Works
Pygame Basics: The project uses Pygame to handle graphics and animation.
Dynamic Effects:
Lighting, snowflakes, and stars are rendered with randomized properties for a natural look.
Alpha transparency is used for creating glowing effects.
Animation Loop: The main loop redraws the screen, updating each element in real time.
